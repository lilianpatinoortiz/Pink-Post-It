### ~ Express.js Challenge: Note Taker üìù

## Description

Motivation:

- In this challenge we learned how to use express to build a server, how to use routers to have a better organization of our backend and how to connect the server to the interface!

Why this project was created:

- This project was created to practice our express knowledge and the usage of routes, files, and local database (json file)

What are we solving:

- This challenge will help you to track notes, so you can access them from any device :)

What we learned:

- We learned how to build a server from scratch, connect it to a local db (json file), build the routes to have a better control of the apis and finally conect it to the ui to make an actual functional aplication.
